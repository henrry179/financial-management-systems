### 09. Portfolio Volatility 2
- **Expected Portfolio Volatility**
    - Definition: Variability in portfolio value, creating risk and opportunity
    - Calculation Methods
        - Real Portfolio Volatility: Based on historical returns
        - Expected Portfolio Volatility: Predicts future volatility based on inputs
            - Benefits
                - Understanding expected risk and opportunity
                - Modeling volatility under different scenarios
                - Targeting specific volatility levels
                - Setting reasonable portfolio stock levels
- **Portfolio Volatility Components**
    - Weightings: Percentage of portfolio allocated to each asset
    - Variances: Measure of asset volatility (standard deviation squared)
    - Covariances: Measure the relationship between two assets
        - Correlation: Normalized covariance, bounded between -1 and 1
- **Portfolio Volatility Equation**
    - Functions of weightings, variances, and covariances
    - Variance-Covariance Matrix
        - Diagonal: Variances of individual assets
        - Off-diagonal: Covariances between assets
    - Portfolio Volatility Increase
        - As portfolio size increases, covariance terms outweigh variance terms
        - Relationships between assets impact portfolio volatility more than individual asset volatility
- **Diversification Effects**
    - Reduction in portfolio volatility with more assets, assuming non-perfect correlation
    - Correlation impacts the slope of volatility reduction
        - Higher correlations: Shallower slope, less diversification effect
        - Lower correlations: Steeper slope, greater diversification effect
    - Over-diversification warning
        - Dilutes returns from high-quality ideas
        - Difficulty in continuously finding low-correlation ideas
