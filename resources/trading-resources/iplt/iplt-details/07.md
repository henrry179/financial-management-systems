### 07. Implied Volatility 2
- **Introduction to Implied Volatility**
    - Definition: Forward-looking measure derived from options prices
    - Contrast with Realized Volatility: More accurate and specific due to forward-looking nature
    - Importance: Provides market's expectation of future volatility
- **Option Basics**
    - Derivative Products: Prices based on underlying asset
    - Pricing Inputs: Underlying asset price, time to expiry, implied volatility
    - Implied Volatility: Estimated volatility assumed by the market for the underlying asset
- **Implied Volatility Calculation**
    - Spreadsheet Overview
        - Implied Volatility Calculators: Three types depending on exercise style and dividend payment
        - Summary Worksheet: Consolidates information for analysis
        - Resources: Links for options and pricing inputs
    - Calculation Process
        - Step 1: Gather Preliminary Information
            - Exercise Style: American or European
            - Dividend Payment: Yield or discrete dividend
