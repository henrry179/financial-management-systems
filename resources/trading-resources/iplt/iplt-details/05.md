### 05. Realized Volatility 3
- **Average True Range Percentage (ATRP) Method**
    - Second method for calculating realized historical volatility
    - Crude measure for retail traders
    - Provides quicker answers compared to distribution of returns analysis
    - Used as a shortcut to understand volatility without compromising time
    - Definition and Calculation
        - True Range: Largest number from high-low, high-previous close, or previous close-low
        - True Range Percentage: True Range divided by open
        - Average True Range Percentage: Average of True Range Percentage over a given period
    - Results and Interpretation
        - S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) comparisons
        - Volatility patterns across different time horizons (quarterly, annually, etc.)
        - Impact of significant events (e.g., 2020 COVID-19 sell-off) on shorter-term data sets
- **Comparison with Distribution of Returns Analysis**
    - Both methods lead to similar conclusions regarding volatility and opportunities
        - ATRP lacks depth in understanding asset behavior compared to distribution of returns
        - ATRP is suitable for crude realized volatility assessment and as a head check for distribution of returns analysis
    - Key Findings
        - Volatility and opportunities increase with trading time horizons and sliding down the market cap scale within equities
        - Mid-cap and large-cap stocks offer consistent volatility and wholesale opportunities
        - Mega-cap stocks, including FAANG, show higher volatility in the short term but are less volatile over longer periods
- **Volatility Across Asset Classes**
    - Low volatility observed in government bonds, corporate bonds, major FX, emerging markets FX, equity indices
        - Higher volatility in mega-cap stocks, particularly FAANG, due to their high correlation and limited opportunity set
        - Large-cap and mid-cap stocks provide consistent returns and opportunities due to higher earnings volatility and frequent market cap changes
- **Retail vs. Professional Traders**
    - Professional traders have a deeper understanding of risk and opportunity in assets
        - Retail traders can use ATRP for quick answers but should aim to understand distribution of returns for sophistication
        - Professional traders use distribution of returns to calculate odds of returns within certain time periods
- **Summary**
    - ATRP is a viable and accurate measure for retail traders to gauge expectations of volatility and return
        - Distribution of returns analysis offers more depth and allows calculating odds of certain returns within a time period
        - Both methods confirm that extending trading time horizons to 1-3 months in mid-cap and large-cap equities provides consistent opportunities and volatility
        - Understanding and utilizing both methods enhances a trader's ability to assess risk and opportunity effectively
