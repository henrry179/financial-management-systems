### 10. Becoming a Professional Level Trader
- **Key Themes and Processes**
    - Differences Between Professional Traders and Retail Traders
        - Expectations Management: Professional traders aim for slow, steady wealth accumulation over time, focusing on consistent risk-adjusted returns. Retail traders often seek quick wins, leading to account blow-ups.
        - Income Strategy: Professional traders do not consider trading accounts as income sources; they treat them as assets for wealth creation. Retail traders often misinterpret trading accounts as income generators.
        - Absolute Return Mandate: Professionals pursue absolute returns, aiming to profit in both up and down markets, unlike retail traders who may peg performance against market indices.
        - Risk-Reward Profile: Pro traders aim for the highest return possible from the lowest risk, maximizing Sharpe ratio, whereas retail traders may not prioritize risk management effectively.
    - Understanding the Industry Landscape
        - Competency Hierarchy: Transition from unconscious incompetence (lack of awareness of own incompetence) to conscious incompetence (awareness of incompetence), then to conscious competence (competence with effort), and finally, unconscious competence (expertise without conscious effort).
        - Educational Development: Learning the systematic process of professional trading, including trade idea generation, timing, structuring, portfolio building, and risk management.
    - Volatility and Its Application
        - Realized Volatility (Distribution of Returns): Analyzing historical data to understand risk and opportunities in different time horizons and asset classes.
        - Average True Range Percentage (ATRP): A simpler method for gauging expected returns in a specific time period.
        - Implied Volatility: Calculating expectations of future volatility, crucial for understanding market sentiment and hedging strategies.
        - Portfolio Volatility: Modeling different portfolios to understand risk and opportunity, choosing the level of annual risk to take and targeting annual expected returns.
- **Educational Development Pathways**
    - Theoretical Learning
        - Professional Trading Masterclass (PTM): Covers trade idea generation, timing, structuring, portfolio building, and preemptive/reactive risk management.
        - Professional Options Trading Masterclass (POTM): Focuses on using options to enhance ROI, bring asymmetric risk-reward, and become more agnostic in timing and risk management.
        - Forex Market Program: Expands knowledge into forex markets, although not a core skill set for professional portfolio managers.
    - Practical Implementation
        - Live Trading: Essential for developing reactive risk management skills and gaining real-world experience.
        - Mentoring Programs: Offers personalized guidance, critique, and analysis of trade ideas, timing, structuring, portfolio building, and risk management.
- **Conclusion and Next Steps**
    - Examination: A 30-question multiple-choice exam to test understanding of the IPL LT video series.
        - Continued Learning: Encouragement to revisit videos, practice learned methods, and progress through additional video series and mentoring programs.
        - Professional References: Opportunity to list the Institute of Trading and Portfolio Management as a reference on resumes and professional networking profiles upon successful completion of programs.
